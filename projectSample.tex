% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{enumitem}
\setlist[itemize]{leftmargin=3 cm}
\setlist[enumerate]{leftmargin=3cm}



% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% Titles are generally capitalized except for words such as a, an, and, as,

%
%\IEEEcompsocitemizethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted
% lists the Computer Society journals use for "first footnote" author
% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript
% received ..."  text while in non-compsoc journals this is reversed. Sigh.

\author{Project Designers: Ethan Seiber, Jamel Warren, and Hunter Haislip\\ % <-this % stops a space
}
%Generally you should be the only author, so drop Michael Shell's name when you are creating your lab reports

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
In the course of the next couple of months we will develop and present a 2D game named ``Burning Choices". The game will primarily focus on the adventure genre. It will include multiple levels and hopefully branching story depending on the time constraints. The game took inspiration from Bandersnatch, a fictitious game in the Netflix original series Black Mirror that also included branching story line. The target audience will be those that enjoy classic action arcade style games. Things achieved thus far: we have made the functionality that will allow us to create obstacles, any interaction objects like doors and walls, in our window.xaml, along with this we have implemented character models to represent movement and an idle character.

\section{Introduction}
The project is a 2D adventure game that will operate around theme of angels, demons and humans. The end goal of the project is to tell a story that branches depending on the actions of the player. The audience for this project would be those who enjoy retro style games. The audience will play the game and leave feeling satisfied/ entertained if we do our jobs right. The reason why we have chosen this project is thanks to different interests ranging from a love of video games to things we enjoy in our own lives and would like to create ourselves. The story will follow the player as they find their way through our world overcoming any obstacles in their way. In doing so they are given the ability to control their own story.

% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.
% However, the Computer Society has been known to put floats at the bottom.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

\subsection{Background}
Throughout the paper these terms will be used in describing certain aspects or situations in the game. 2D graphics, branching storyline and linear storyline. 2D graphics refers to the dimensions of of the art style within the game i.e. 2D graphics is short for 2 dimensional graphics. Mario for the nintendo 64 is a great example of 2D graphics. Branching storyline refers to the story structure and how the story of the game is built. The story that is produced depends on the choice of the player. This means the player could end up with a completely different ending or story leading to the ending depending on what they do in the game. Linear storyline also refers to the story structure within the game. A linear storyline is much like reading a book. From beginning to end the story is static and unchanging with only one ending.  This is a team project so we all have our own motivations for deciding to make a game. For both Ethan and Jamel it's the video game aspect of it because we are both fans of video games. For Hunter it's the idea. Hunter received inspiration from the Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch to make the game have multiple endings based on player choice. Hence the title Burning Choices.

\subsection{Challenges}
Some of the challenges we suspect to run into include programming the interaction between the player and environment, player movement and the creation many levels that are connected to each other so the player may move between levels. This is drastically different from any programming projects we have attempted before. We have learned about gathering user input and manipulating it, but we need to manipulate it in a way that interacts with objects or the player. Creating in game objects like obstacles, doors and keys leads in to the environment interaction challenge. Saved games are a necessity for games which entails gathering the players current place in the world as well as their choices in the story and then being able to use this to load their progress when they start up the game. The last expected challenge is to create our different story lines and make sure they lead to an ending. Lastly is the debugging. This is more of a patience challenge to try and break our game. To address these challenges we will need to do some research on useful libraries to help provide pre- defined functionality or create our own functionality.

\section{Scope}
The project will be finished when we have at least three in game levels, a linear storyline, can save, and the world builds and functions properly. The stretch goals we have set for this project are the branching storylines and more than three in game levels.

\subsection{Requirements}
The functional requirements for this project were gathered from experience in other games. The functional requirements for games are typically things that make life easier as well as providing a logical order to the project.

\subsubsection{Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item The program should load up the game ``Burning Choices" and start on the title screen.
\item The game will allow for saved games.
\item The player can choose from the title menu to do things like load a game or start a new one or quit.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item Recoverability- If the game crashes then it can be rebooted and the user can restart using an auto save.
\item Maintainability- Given this project is relatively small it makes it easy to find and get rid of any bugs within. This means in the long run being able to maintain this project will be relatively simple especially as we discover and fix bugs.
\end{itemize}

\label{tab:useCaseIndex}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item[Use Case Number:] 1
\item[Use Case Name:] Starting the story.
\item[Description:] The user is on the title screen and wants to start the story of the game. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The user will click on New Game to start a new story.
\item The game starts at the beginning of the story.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item[Use Case Number:] 2
\item[Use Case Name:] Game saving
\item[Description:] The user reaches a point in the game where they wish to save their progress.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The user will hit the Esc key to pause the game.
\item A list of menu items will pop up.
\item The game environment will pause allowing the user time to read the items.
\item The user will select Save Game in the pause menu.
\item The game will store the player's story data in a file created by the executable.
\item The game will un- pause and continue where the user left off.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item[Use Case Number:] 3
\item[Use Case Name:] Exiting Game
\item[Description:] After playing for a while the user will want to quit the game.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The user will hit the Esc key to pause the game.
\item A list of items will pop up.
\item If the user selects Quit the game will exit and stop running.
\end{enumerate}

Alternative: User is on the title screen
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user will navigate to the bottom of the title screen.
\item The user will click quit and the game will exit.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item[Use Case Number:] 4
\item[Use Case Name:] Load Game
\item[Description:] The user is on the title screen and wishes to continue where they left off in the story.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The user will see a menu item that reads ``Load Game".
\item The user will click ``Load Game". 
\item The game will open the file holding the saved data of where the user last saved.
\item Using the saved data the game will load to the point where the user last saved in the story.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Interface Mockups}

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{BurningChoicesGameplay.png}
\caption{The gameplay so far}
\label{gameplay_1}
Currently we have the ability to add in walls as we want which allows us to start building on our game environment. In this picture the player is attempting to pass through a wall that cannot be passed through. This picture also shows the color and art style that can be expected within the game environment.
\end{figure}
 


\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{BurningChoicesMenu.png}
\caption{A layout of the Title Screen}
\label{TS}
This is what we want our title screen to look like once we are finished with the project except we plan to replace start with new game because we recognize how ambiguous it is. This image is the first thing that will pop up when you run the game. It shows you what we envision use cases 1 and 4 to be like. The Resume option, case 4, will allow the player to load a game to continue the story where they left off and the Start option, case 1, will begin a new game from the beginning of the story. The Quit option pertains to use case 3's alternative in which the user is on the title screen and wants to quit the game.
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{BurningChoicesPauseScreen.png}
\caption{A layout of the pause screen}
\label{PS}
This is the current version of our pause screen. You know it's the pause screen because it tells you the game is paused at the top. The screen will give you the three options to choose from. The Resume button will un-pause the game and continue the user where they left off. The save option is use case 2 which will record the user's current progress within the story and save it to a file to be loaded later. Then at the bottom of the list is quit which is use case 3. This will close the game entirely.
\end{figure}

\section{Project Timeline}
The time line for this project starts with the requirements phase. It will last from January 2019 to January 2019. This phase is simple and took little time to complete. We gathered what most games have that would be useful in the context of our game.

Next is the design phase. This phase is being developed still. Meaning we started out with our base line ideas we discussed in the beginning, but have modified them as time has gone on. This phase lasted from February through March because we will not be adding any new ideas.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We deliberate on the type of gameplay we will have.
\item Discuss the story.
\item Decide a theme for the whole game.
\item Deliberate on some design patterns to use.
\end{enumerate}

Then comes the implementation phase this will take the most time.  We plan for this to last from February through April. In this time we plan to have these things finished.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Levels designed (In Progress)
\item Obstacle class made (In Progress)
\item The story implemented
\end{enumerate}
This sums up the time line we have set for ourselves because the verification and maintenance steps will be taken care of in the implementation step as we progress in the project.
\section{Project Structure}
Currently we have decided to use an Abstract Factory design pattern to define and create any objects we will use within the game such as walls and doors.
\newpage
\subsection{UML Outline}


\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale= 0.4]{BurningChoicesUML.png}
\caption{This is the current UML plan we have for our project. It is not finished, but thus far we have a plan for any in game object such as walls, doors and items as well as functionality for our MainWindow class}
\label{UML}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Design Patterns Used}
Currently we are using the Abstract Factory design patter as one of our patterns.

\section{Results}
The project stands at being able to freely create walls to restrict the player's movement. This is still buggy when it comes to more than 3 walls is the current thought, but the belief could change as we begin debugging. It could be buggy for another reason.

\subsection{Future Work}
The next steps we will take are to smooth out the object tracking bugs and work out the implementation for doors i.e. objects that will open another level.
