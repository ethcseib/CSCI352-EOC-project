Purpose: To create a game that is entertaining and of quality.
Files Needed: BurningChoices code folder
How to run: Open the .sln in Visual Studio or run the .exe file.
Challenges: Collision checking was hard and was a problem for the longest time
	Then the story implementation was difficult because of the amount of 
	time it takes to implement.
Design Decisions: We used two design patterns. The abstract factory pattern
	and the observer pattern
Bugs: Some walls still have collision problems.


We finished the project with the majority of the goals we set out to 
accomplish.
If we had more time we would spend the time smoothing out the bugs as well as
reaching our other unreached goals.
